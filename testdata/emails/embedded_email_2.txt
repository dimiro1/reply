I have checked the available documentation/links to find out the end points. If there are some other endpoints, can you please tell the endpoints

Best Regards

   You are not using the right endpoint, go to user profile / badges, have a look at dev tools to see what it calls
 There is a discrete endpoint to get all the badges a user has

   To respond, reply to this email or visit the topic.
