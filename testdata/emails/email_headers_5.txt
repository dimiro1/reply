Hi Erlend,

I don’t know what a “legally recognised educational institution” means for you.

We’re based in Sweden and we provide education to our people across the globe.

We want to try Discourse in small scale first to see it will add value to our communities.

Best regards,

//Jef

Hi Jef,

Is your University a legally recognised educational institution? Otherwise I'm afraid you're not eligible for this discount.

Sincerely,

Erlend
